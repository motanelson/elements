🧩 Project Summary

This project is a game template that combines 3D concepts with CSV data manipulation, designed to teach applied mathematics and spatial representation in a practical and visual way.
It provides a simple Python-based foundation where students and developers can explore how data and coordinates can be transformed into an interactive visual environment.


---

🎯 Purpose

The main idea behind this project is to bring together two communities — the data enthusiasts and the game developers — into a single educational experience.
It aims to serve as a learning tool for anyone interested in:

Understanding data structures and reading CSV files;

Representing coordinates in 2D and 3D spaces;

Exploring mathematical concepts applied to digital games.



---

👨‍🏫 Target Audience

Students of mathematics, computer science, or related fields;

Developers curious about 2D/3D graphics in Python;

Anyone who wants to learn visually how data can become “games.”



---

💡 Educational Vision

This project is not just about coding — it’s about learning through visualization.
By merging the logic of data with the creativity of 3D spaces, it helps learners see how abstract mathematical ideas can take form and movement inside a game environment.


---

🙌 Acknowledgment

Dedicated to my followers and community —
those who work with data and CSV files, and those who love 2D and 3D games.
This project exists to connect both worlds and inspire new ways of learning.



🎲 Game.Board.2D

A simple 2D/3D game template that blends data, math, and visual logic.

🧩 Project Summary

Game.Board.2D is a game template that combines 3D spatial concepts with CSV data manipulation, designed to teach applied mathematics and data representation through a visual and interactive experience.

It offers a simple Python-based foundation for students and developers who want to explore how coordinates and data can be transformed into a dynamic visual board.


---

🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to bring together two different communities —
the data developers who work with CSV and analysis, and the game enthusiasts who love 2D/3D environments.

This project serves as a bridge between both worlds, providing an educational tool to explore:

How to structure and read CSV data in Python;

How to represent coordinates in 2D and 3D;

How mathematical ideas can become interactive visual forms.



---

👨‍🏫 Target Audience

Students of mathematics, data science, or computer graphics;

Developers curious about simple 2D and 3D rendering in Python;

Teachers and learners who want to visualize mathematical and spatial concepts.



---

💡 Educational Vision

This project is not only about game development — it’s about learning through visualization.
By merging data logic with 3D thinking, learners can discover how abstract mathematics can become something they can see, move, and experiment with.
