🧩 Project Summary

This project is a game template that combines 3D concepts with CSV data manipulation, designed to teach applied mathematics and spatial representation in a practical and visual way.
It provides a simple Python-based foundation where students and developers can explore how data and coordinates can be transformed into an interactive visual environment.

🎯 Purpose

The main idea behind this project is to bring together two communities — the data enthusiasts and the game developers — into a single educational experience.
It aims to serve as a learning tool for anyone interested in:

Understanding data structures and reading CSV files;

Representing coordinates in 2D and 3D spaces;

Exploring mathematical concepts applied to digital games.



---

👨‍🏫 Target Audience

Students of mathematics, computer science, or related fields;

Developers curious about 2D/3D graphics in Python;

Anyone who wants to learn visually how data can become “games.”

💡 Educational Vision

This project is not just about coding — it’s about learning through visualization.
By merging the logic of data with the creativity of 3D spaces, it helps learners see how abstract mathematical ideas can take form and movement inside a game environment.
